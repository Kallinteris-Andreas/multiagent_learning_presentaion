Hi We are Kallinteris and Orfanoudakis
and we are going to be presenting a paper on improving MA learning perfomance by altering
the definition of agents


### AgentFactor:
there exist (complex) domains in which it is very hard for a single agent system to
perform the required tasks and learn.
and in those domains we split the worload to multiple each repsonsible for a part of the
domain.


### agent Factor Flex:
there exist multi agent systems in which the defintion of the agents is natural result of 
the enviroment
while others like network routing enable more flexible agent definition
imagine having a network with 1mil nodes producers and consumers on a complex topology
how do you define agents to route packages
this paper on choosing the best agent defition of learning.


### domain
This paper uses the routing of AGV (imagine amazon warehouse) as an example of defining 
agents
In this domain (which we represent in a graph) we have AGV and routes(with capacity)...
The agent system job is to creative incetives for routing while dynamicaly
avoiding congested areas
